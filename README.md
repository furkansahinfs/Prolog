# Prolog
Reposity for Prolog Homework
There is a list of numbers for which we know that there are exactly two occurrences of each number "except one". Please write a Prolog code to find this irregular number in the list.
Example: For the list â€˜(2 3 2 4 1 6 1 3 6), the sought irregular number is 4.
